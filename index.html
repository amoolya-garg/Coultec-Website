    <h1>OUR ALL-IN-ONE SOLUTION</h1>
    <h2>MOTOR</h2>
    <p>Our Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors are developed using the same process that earned victories in motorsport competitions. Every motor is tailored through close collaboration with the customer—from defining torque and thermal demands to testing hardware under simulated load cycles. This allows us to optimize performance across the board: from magnetic topology and cooling to winding design and housing geometry. Each prototype undergoes multiple iterations and vigorous testing before entering production, ensuring it's not only high-performing but fit for purpose in real-world conditions. With this process, our motors become more than components—they become precision-matched enablers of efficient, reliable mobility.

      <h2>INVERTER AND CONTROLLER</h2>
    <p>Our inverter offering follows the same meticulous development path: customer alignment, technical requirement definition, and validation through pilot runs. The result is a split inverter system capable of controlling one or two motors with minimal adaptation. Whether you're building an agile city EV or a powerful dual-motor drivetrain, we customize the inverter's performance envelope, switching behavior, and thermal handling to suit your application. Extensive simulation and hardware-in-the-loop testing ensure the system performs precisely as needed, with software interfaces and control logic tuned to your system architecture. It’s not just flexible—it’s tailor-made for the way you drive innovation. </p>

    <p>We don’t just build electric powertrains—we engineer solutions around your specific needs. Every project begins with a deep technical dialogue to understand your goals, constraints, and performance targets. From there, we follow a structured development pipeline: custom design, simulation, parameterization, hardware prototyping, thorough validation testing and multiple pilot runs. This iterative process ensures the final product is optimized not just in theory, but for your exact application</p>

    <p>Whether you require a complete powertrain system or only specific components, our modular approach gives you full flexibility. We offer the motor, inverter, and motor controller as individual packages—each bundled with dedicated software and integration support. This allows OEMs and startups alike to seamlessly integrate our high-performance technology into their own platforms, without committing to an all-in-one solution. Our engineering services are as adaptable as our hardware—ensuring you get only what you need, backed by the same precision, performance, and reliability throughout.</p>

  <!-- About Section -->
  <section id="about" class="section content-section">
    <h1>About</h1>
    <img src="coultecb1.jpg" alt="About Image 1">
    <p>Our story began in 2021, when a group of Rennteam University of Stuttgart alumni founded the company after their team’s victory at Formula Student Germany. Leveraging the technical expertise and entrepreneurial spirit developed through Formula Student, we initially focused on building high-performance electric motors inspired by our race-winning designs. This hands-on experience enabled us to quickly expand our R&D to include in-house inverter development.
      By 2022, we had secured our first client for pilot runs and on-road deployments—an early validation of our product-market fit. As our technology matured, we expanded into the European market, delivering fully integrated powertrain systems—including motor, inverter, control unit, and software—for small electric vehicles by 2024. 
      Encouraged by our success and growing demand, we set our sights on the commercial lightweight vehicle segment. Backed by a new funding partner, we entered a new phase of growth. In 2025, we scaled down our system to meet the unique needs of the Asian market and are currently engaged in pilot trials with our local partner. 
      From Formula Student roots to real-world road deployments, our journey has been driven by a commitment to engineering excellence and continuous innovation in integrated powertrain technology.
